                My family has been coming here for over 15 years. It's our celebration spot for every soccer game, piano recital and graduation.
                We cannot expect better quality food or service from anywhere else.

                ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
                <br><br>
                My wife and I have been married for 5 years now, and this restaurant is where we had our first date.
                We come back here every year on our anniversary, and it's wonderful to relive the good moments. Gary Blue's is the key to a happy marriage!

                ⭐⭐⭐⭐
                <br><br>
                Gary Blue's is always a good spot to eat. BUT, I've held a grudge since they took away the zesty chicken fries in 2002. #BringBackTheZest
